# Overview
SLIDE uses the feature-feature correlation structure in the data to create latent factors. Input data does not need to be autoscaled (meaning each feature has `mean = 0` and `std dev = 1`), as this is done when calculating the latent factors. However, there are a few important considerations:

* Normalization is still recommended (such as normalizing for read-depth or library size); other transformations (log, power,etc) may be recommended for specific data types. 
* `thresh_fdr` argument sets the threshold below which correlations (in the scaled correlation matrix) will be removed. The default is `0.2`, but use a lower value to get more diverse latent factors.
  + Occasionally, `thresh_fdr` and `delta` will cause the algorithm to fail because the remaining correlations in the data are too sparse and more than `delta` apart from each other. Consider lowering both if you encounter problems.

The sections below outline:

1. Sample data
2. Remove features with `std dev = 0`
3. Handling missing values
    + data repair
    + imputation
4. Filtering
    + sparsity
    + variance
    <!-- + coefficient of variation -->




# Sample Data
Below are some examples using example data (note, download these files from the examples folder on the SLIDE repo at jishnu-lab/SLIDE):
```{r load_example_data, eval = F}
unfiltered_x = as.matrix(read.csv('SLIDE/Data_Scripts/CD4_Expansion/x.csv', row.names = 1))
unfiltered_y = as.matrix(read.csv('SLIDE/Data_Scripts/CD4_Expansion/y.csv', row.names = 1))

```

```{r actual_load_example_data, echo = F}
unfiltered_x = as.matrix(read.csv('/ix/djishnu/Aaron/1_general_use/SLIDE/Data_Scripts/CD4_Expansion/x.csv', row.names = 1))
unfiltered_y = as.matrix(read.csv('/ix/djishnu/Aaron/1_general_use/SLIDE/Data_Scripts/CD4_Expansion/y.csv', row.names = 1))

```

# Remove features with `standard dev = 0`
First things first: remove all features that have a `std dev = 0` because these are uninformative and will cause errors in calculating the correlation matrix in SLIDE.

```{r remove_zero_sd}
# find columns with sd = 0
zero_sd_features = which(apply(unfiltered_x, 2, sd) == 0)

filtered_x = unfiltered_x[, -zero_sd_features]
```

# Handling Missing Values
SLIDE requires that the input sample-feature data be a numeric matrix and contain no characters or `NA`/`NAN`/`Inf` values. 

## Data repair - Find `NA`/`NAN`/`Inf` values
```{r find-bad-values}

# this will give you a vector with positions in the flattened matrix
bad_values = which(is.na(unfiltered_x) | is.nan(unfiltered_x) | is.infinite(unfiltered_x))

# you can replace the bad values with zeros or see below for imputation
repaired_x = unfiltered_x[bad_values] = 0
```

## Imputation
If you wish to impute values (for example, by using the mean), you can do so similarly
```{r impute-bad-values}
# same as above
bad_values = which(is.na(unfiltered_x) | is.nan(unfiltered_x) | is.infinite(unfiltered_x))

# go through each column and replace bad values with the mean of that column
imputed_x = apply(unfiltered_x, MARGIN = 2, function(x) x[which(is.na(x) | is.nan(x) | is.infinite(x))] = mean(x, na.rm = TRUE))
```

# Filtering
* **Sparsity**: both in features and samples will create problems. Consider removing features, then samples based on sparsity (generally, any sample filtering should come after feature filtering). 
  + A good initial check is to see how many features have `median = 0` (50% of feature are zeros) - if there are a significant number of these features, instead of removing all of them consider removing features that have more than 50% zeros (e.g. remove features that are 90% zeros or 75% zeros). Afterwards, do the same for samples (although we are generally more conservative and only remove samples that have a significant proportion of zeros).
* **Variance**: Low variance features are less informative, so Consider filtering these out. 
  + Remove features with `std dev = 0`, because these are uninformative
* **Coefficient of Variation**: Ratio of feature `std dev / mean`. Features with high coefficient of variation may be noise and features with low coefficient of variation may be uninformative.

## Sparsity Filtering

### Filtering features (columns)
You can measure the proportion of zeros in each row/column. Start by filtering out features, then filter samples
```{r sparsity-filter, out.width = "80%"}
proportion_col_zeros = apply(unfiltered_x, MARGIN = 2, 
                             function(x) length(which(x == 0))/length(x))

hist(proportion_col_zeros, xlab = "Proportion/% of Zeros in each column")
```

We can now remove any column that has more than `0.9` (90%) zeros.
```{r sparsity-filter-cols, out.width = "80%"}

filtered_x = unfiltered_x[, -which(proportion_col_zeros > 0.9)]
```
Note: we can use these vectors with the quantile function to set a threshold for percentage of zeros - note: you can also use the quantile function.
<!-- # ```{r sparsity-filter-col} -->
<!-- # # Get indices for cols that are the top 10% sparse -->
<!-- # cols_above_zero_threshold = which(proportion_col_zeros > quantile(proportion_col_zeros, 0.9)) -->
<!-- #  -->
<!-- # filtered_x = unfiltered_x[, -cols_above_zero_threshold] -->
<!-- # ``` -->

### Filtering samples (rows)
We can do the same for rows (**remember to remove the corresponding rows from your response vector as well!**)
```{r sparsity-filter-rows, out.width = "80%"}
# Get indices for rows that are the top 10% sparse
proportion_row_zeros = apply(unfiltered_x, MARGIN = 1, function(x) length(which(x == 0))/length(x))

hist(proportion_row_zeros, xlab = "Proportion/% of Zeros in each row")

rows_above_zero_threshold = which(proportion_row_zeros > 0.9)

filtered_x = unfiltered_x[-rows_above_zero_threshold, ]
filtered_y = unfiltered_y[-rows_above_zero_threshold]
```


Note: you may want to filter out zeros based on absolute number (versus just filtering out by quantile); in this case, your apply function will not normalize for length:
```{r absolute-sparsity-filtering, out.width = "80%"}
absolute_num_col_zeros = apply(unfiltered_x, MARGIN = 2, 
                               function(x) length(which(x == 0)))
absolute_num_row_zeros = apply(unfiltered_x, MARGIN = 1, 
                               function(x) length(which(x == 0)))

# should look the same as hist for row % above
hist(absolute_num_row_zeros)
```

Alternatively, you can use the `zeroFiltering` function in the SLIDE package:
- Features with more than `col_thresh` zeros will be filtered out 
- Samples with more than `row`_thresh` zeros will be filtered out

```{r zero-filtering, eval = T}
# this will remove all features and samples that have more than 50% zeros (any feature or column with median = 0)
col_thresh = nrow(unfiltered_x)/2
row_thresh = ncol(unfiltered_x)/2

#columns with more than col_thresh number of zeros will be filtered
#rows with more than row_thresh number of zeros will be filtered
filtered_mats = SLIDE::zeroFiltering(unfiltered_x, unfiltered_y, col_thresh = nrow(unfiltered_x)/2, row_thresh = ncol(unfiltered_x)/2)
filtered_x = filtered_mats$filtered_x
filtered_x = filtered_mats$filtered_y
```

## Variance Filtering

We use similar functions to filter by variance; generally speaking, you will want to look at the variance of mean-centered data (although your input data does not need to be centered or scaled, as that is done in SLIDE)

```{r col-variance, out.width = "80%"}

# mean center each column
scaled_x = apply(unfiltered_x, MARGIN = 2, function(x) scale(x, center = TRUE, scale = FALSE))

# get the variance of each column
col_variance = apply(scaled_x, MARGIN = 2, var)

hist(col_variance)
```
Next, using this histogram, we want to filter out features with low variance. It looks like `0.20` is a good choice to remove the lowest variance features
```{r col-variance_abs, out.width = "80%"}

# we can filter out features with very low variance (typically we use somewhere between the 25th-45th percentiles). We use 25th percentile below
low_var_cols = which(col_variance < 0.2)

filtered_x = unfiltered_x[, -low_var_cols]
```

Alternatively, we filter out the bottom 25th percentile by variance. We can also use the `quantile` function to control the number of features we filter, and so that we don't need to explicitly pick a variance threshold (e.g. filtering out the 25th percentile removes the lowest 25% of features by variance)

Note, you can repeat this same process for rows by changing the `MARGIN` argument in the apply function - e.g. for columns, `MARGIN = 2` `apply(unfiltered_x, MARGIN = 2, var)` and for rows, `MARGIN = 1` `apply(unfiltered_x, MARGIN = 1, var)`

```{r col-variance_quantile, out.width = "80%"}

# we can filter out features with very low variance (typically we use somewhere between the 25th-45th percentiles). We use 25th percentile below
low_var_cols = which(col_variance < quantile(col_variance, 0.25))

filtered_x = unfiltered_x[, -low_var_cols]
```

<!-- ## Coefficient of Variation Filtering -->

<!-- We can also filter by coefficient of variation (`sd(x)/mean(x)`). As stated above, features with high coefficient of variation may be noise and features with low coefficient of variation may be uninformative. We can again use the `quantile` function to filter out the top 5th percentile (noise) and bottom 5th percentile (uninformative) -->
<!-- ```{r col-coef-var, out.width = "80%"} -->

<!-- # mean center each column -->
<!-- scaled_x = apply(unfiltered_x, MARGIN = 2, function(x) scale(x, center = TRUE, scale = FALSE)) -->

<!-- # get the variance of each column -->
<!-- col_coefficient_variation = apply(scaled_x, MARGIN = 2, function(x) sd(x)/mean(x)) -->

<!-- hist(col_coefficient_variation) -->

<!-- # we typically filter out somewhere between the top/bottom 5-10% of features; filtering out top and bottom 5% shown below -->
<!-- low_coeff_var_cols = which(col_coefficient_variation < quantile(col_coefficient_variation, 0.05) | col_coefficient_variation > quantile(col_coefficient_variation, 0.95)) -->

<!-- filtered_x = unfiltered_x[, -low_coeff_var_cols] -->
<!-- ``` -->
